Each player starts the game by drawing two objectives and one enemy, kept secret unless the player decides to disclose them. Their goal is to achieve their objectives, ideally by as wide a margin as possible, while preventing their enemy from achieving their enemy's objectives.
              <br/><br/>This sequence of events makes up a single "issue cycle", of which there are 7 over the course of the game. Each "issue cycle" is centered around a particular issue card, and each player has different strengths and weaknesses they can exercise over the course of this cycle.</h3>

            <p class="text-muted">From the beginning, we knew we had to make intentional decisions about how we used our time. We knew we wanted to make major improvements to the physical game prototype itself, but we also wanted to revisit some of the fundamentals of gameplay and redesign the game's aesthetic - and since print shops and game production sites require turnaround time, we couldn't do everything we wanted in just a few weeks.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">We ended up taking a middle ground: we invested most of our time in improving gameplay and aesthetic design, but were able to produce a prototype close to the quality we were looking for by making and purchasing pieces ourselves à la carte (and rushing a Kinko's order!).</p>

            <h4 class="service-heading">Game Mechanics and Playtesting</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">One of the biggest challenges we faced was making sure that we had correctly accounted for all the possible states of the game, to avoid any unwinnable states or other undesirable behavior, in the context of limited testing opportunities.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">Because our game currently takes an hour to play - and doing so for the first time takes even longer - it was difficult to find volunteers willing to playtest our game all the way through. Instead, we were forced to test different "playable slices" on different groups of people. Combined with the playtesting we did in P2, we did feel like we had enough information to make the decisions we needed to make about game mechanics, but it would have been much better if we could have found volunteers who we didn't know who were willing to sit through the entire game during week 9 of the quarter in particular.</p>

            </span>
            <h4 class="service-heading">Extracting Feedback</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">Our team had a strong vision for the types of conditions under which our game would truly shine. Our game has great potential for strategic play - we observed this when Kylie, a past collaborator, made some interesting strategic decisions during a playtest - but it is hard to do so without more familiarity with the game than any of our other playtesters had. In addition, we had limited time, attention, and emotional investment during our playtests. This made it hard to necessarily feel like we were getting the right kind of feedback from our testing. It was also hard to be sure which feedback we got was relevant to the onboarding process, and which was relevant to the fundamental game mechanics. We ultimately solved this problem by triaging feedback, but testing with more familiar audiences and under conditions more similar to ideal gameplay would have been helpful.</p>

                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">P2: Quatropolis 1.0</h2><br/>
                  <p>Coming out of P2, we were excited about our game's potential and knew we wanted to keep working on it and improving it. Much of the current structure of gameplay was already in place at the end of P2: we had 4 roles, 4 game states, objectives, 7 issues, and 2 types of resources. We knew that the game had potential, so we identified a few key areas to try to improve.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/process/q1.0.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>From the image above, it is clear that one key potential area for improvement was in the physical production value of the game. Voting was done using coins and macaroni into plastic cups, and instead of game cards we had post-its and half-sheets of paper. The game was certainly playable, but it was neither durable nor aesthetically cohesive. Furthermore, the lack of denominations in counting money (represented, counterintuitively, by macaroni) slowed down gameplay.</p>
                  <p>This leads to another point: we received feedback that the game was slow, confusing, and sometimes frustrating. We needed to find ways to speed up gameplay, clarify rules, and increase excitement and replayability. This would require better physical game items as well as rules modifications.</p>
                  <p>Finally, we wanted to reassess whether we wanted to take the message of the game in any new directions. In P2, we had originally conceived of the game as illustrative of the process of gentrification, but that focus became less clear over the course of the game's development. We wanted to go back to the drawing board a bit and do some intentional research and decision-making around our game's theme and intended teachings.</p>

                  <br/><p>We knew we wanted to make an intentional decision about the complex issues our project was attempting to tackle. We conducted primary and secondary research in two main overlapping areas - tenants' rights and Bay Area gentrification - with the goal of identifying particular concepts and dynamics we wanted to build into the game.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/process/research.png" alt="">
                  <p>We interviewed two Bay Area residents, one South Bay renter in her twenties who had some experience in community organizing and one renter in his forties who had lived in a variety of Bay Area locations. Our conversations with them about the effects of the tech industry, local politics, and various movements working for housing justice allowed us to think more concretely about the phenomena we were attempting to model in some form through Quatropolis.</p>
                  <p>We also conducted secondary research into the history of redlining and housing justice movements in the Bay Area. We vaguely knew before working on this project about the fraught history and racialized class dynamics around housing policy in this area, but reading specifically about local practices of redlining (see image above) and the ways local politics and business affected tenants' and landlords' experiences provided a fascinating historical perspective.</p>

                  <p>Although our research proved helpful in setting the intention for our game, we ultimately decided that there were enough structural issues with the gameplay that adding entirely new aspects wasn't feasible within our short timeframe if we wanted to ultimately have time to produce a physical copy of the game. We turned our attention toward improving the gameplay, and have attached below a full description of that process and decision-making.</p>

                  <p>Playtesting was an important part of our process, but a challenging one. Because Quatropolis is relatively complex, it takes a little while to explain the whole game, and there are some elements of strategy that are hard to incorporate without some experience playing so were hard to test for with new players. In addition, the game itself takes a long time, particularly for new players, so due to time constraints we were forced to test using "playable slices". We certainly gained good insights from them, but it would have been nice to be able to observe full playthroughs with more experienced players. One thing that was quite helpful was watching Kylie, who was in our team during P2, because she did think strategically about the game and had valuable insights about replayability.</p>
                  <p>We have described in more detail the process and results of our playtesting in the revisions document (linked again below).</p>

                  <p>We redesigned both the printed and 3D physical items to facilitate gameplay and add cohesion. We designed and printed issue cards, role cards, enemy cards, objective cards, and a master game states tracker. We also purchased sturdy buckets for voting, personal containers for resources, a die, markers for the game states, and coins and poker chips for money and influence.</p>
                  <p>With more time, we would have liked to build or order a custom, branded game box (mockup above) to contain everything, but this would not have been printable within our timeframe, so we settled for sprucing up an existing box we had using vinyl lining for a neutral, professional feel.</p>
