Each player starts the game by drawing two objectives and one enemy, kept secret unless the player decides to disclose them. Their goal is to achieve their objectives, ideally by as wide a margin as possible, while preventing their enemy from achieving their enemy's objectives.
              <br/><br/>This sequence of events makes up a single "issue cycle", of which there are 7 over the course of the game. Each "issue cycle" is centered around a particular issue card, and each player has different strengths and weaknesses they can exercise over the course of this cycle.</h3>

            <p class="text-muted">From the beginning, we knew we had to make intentional decisions about how we used our time. We knew we wanted to make major improvements to the physical game prototype itself, but we also wanted to revisit some of the fundamentals of gameplay and redesign the game's aesthetic - and since print shops and game production sites require turnaround time, we couldn't do everything we wanted in just a few weeks.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">We ended up taking a middle ground: we invested most of our time in improving gameplay and aesthetic design, but were able to produce a prototype close to the quality we were looking for by making and purchasing pieces ourselves à la carte (and rushing a Kinko's order!).</p>

            <h4 class="service-heading">Game Mechanics and Playtesting</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">One of the biggest challenges we faced was making sure that we had correctly accounted for all the possible states of the game, to avoid any unwinnable states or other undesirable behavior, in the context of limited testing opportunities.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">Because our game currently takes an hour to play - and doing so for the first time takes even longer - it was difficult to find volunteers willing to playtest our game all the way through. Instead, we were forced to test different "playable slices" on different groups of people. Combined with the playtesting we did in P2, we did feel like we had enough information to make the decisions we needed to make about game mechanics, but it would have been much better if we could have found volunteers who we didn't know who were willing to sit through the entire game during week 9 of the quarter in particular.</p>

            </span>
            <h4 class="service-heading">Extracting Feedback</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">Our team had a strong vision for the types of conditions under which our game would truly shine. Our game has great potential for strategic play - we observed this when Kylie, a past collaborator, made some interesting strategic decisions during a playtest - but it is hard to do so without more familiarity with the game than any of our other playtesters had. In addition, we had limited time, attention, and emotional investment during our playtests. This made it hard to necessarily feel like we were getting the right kind of feedback from our testing. It was also hard to be sure which feedback we got was relevant to the onboarding process, and which was relevant to the fundamental game mechanics. We ultimately solved this problem by triaging feedback, but testing with more familiar audiences and under conditions more similar to ideal gameplay would have been helpful.</p>

                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">Interviewing</h2><br/>
                  <p>We conducted 7 interviews with people both affiliated and unaffiliated with Stanford. We asked participants about their thoughts on the concept of fake news as well as about their own news consumption and social media behavior.</p>
                  <p>We noticed a few particularly interesting points. Multiple interviewees talked about clickbait and echo chambers, which ended up becoming the focus of our eventual simulation. In addition, many people talked with skepticism about their own news consumption habits. It seemed that people with a good deal of experience on social media had a sufficiently nuanced understanding of how algorithms suggest content based on past behavior, which eventually pushed us to design a solution aimed primarily at new social media users who might now know as much.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/process/interview.png" alt="">
                  <p>We noted down each interesting insight on a post-it, and then cluster-mapped all the post-its by topic. We then distilled the main takeaways from each topic cluster. Finally, we used these distilled post-its to build a preliminary model of the causes and effects of fake news' viral spread. In this way, all our insights and models came directly from our interview participants' data.</p>

                  <br/><p>We conducted secondary research using published works in order to gain a broader academic understanding of the fake news ecosystem. Based on our findings, we wrote a page-long <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Q122gZKaz2wyZYiPDuuXSAXyarYF2p-DYxAQAcB5ps/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">problem statement</a> outlining the context for our work.</p>
                  </p>Several key findings stood out to us at this point. We noted the tension in how 'value-neutral' algorithms can cause systematically negative phenomena, and discussed the role of sensationalism in user engagement and content curation. At this point, we were interested in exploring the concept of satire, and how satirical news without proper context can be interpreted as truth and can thus function as both a detector of uncritical echo chambers, and an unwitting reinforcer of the same.</p>

                  <p>Finally, we combined our interview findings and secondary research findings to refine our system model. The above diagram is our resulting attempt to portray the smaller feedback loop of a piece of content going viral, within the larger feedback loop of social media, sensationalism, decontextualization, misinformation, mistrust, and socio-political toxicity.</p>

                  <p>Having conducted primary and secondary research into the concept of fake news, we were now tasked with creating an infographic of some kind to illustrate one aspect of our findings. We used the 12-6-2 method to generate and refine ideas. We first each wrote 12 ideas out on post-its, from the boring to the outlandish. Then we chose six of them to develop slightly further on index cards. Finally, we chose two to sketch out on printer paper. We generated a variety of ideas - from a mock newspaper that instead informed the reader about fake news, to a carrier-pigeion-shaped diagram of how information spreads. Some of these ideas made it further than others in our design process...</p>

                  <p>Between the three of us, we built four low-fidelity prototypes that emerged directly from our ideation (below). The first was a fake news feed infographic with pop-outs that explain how to identify fake news. The second was an interactive news feed simulator that shows the user 3 posts at a time and tracks the user's real and potential interests based on which post they click, updating the new posts shown based on demonstrated interest. The third was an interactive digital prototype that tested whether users noticed the advertisements they were shown changing based on their post interaction behavior. The fourth was a mock news article that discussed fake news.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/process/protos-all.png" alt="">
                  <p>We decided to go with an interactive prototype because we wanted to tap into new social media users' interest in the fun and novelty of playing around on social media. We ultimately chose to further develop the second idea, the interactive news feed simulator. We wanted to pull away the curtain of mystery that normally obscures content curation algorithms in order to illustrate dramatically in real-time how a new user can turn their online experience from balanced to an echo chamber quite quickly, and how once their feed is an echo chamber and the algorithm has profiled their interests, fake news proliferates in front of their eyes.</p>
                  <p>We chose PolymerJS for its large library of reusable components, which makes it an excellent tool for rapid prototyping.</p>

                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/process/refinement.png" alt="">
                  <p>Echo chambers are a broad topic. Even after narrowing the solution to the two-part display we have made, we found it challenging to identify the most important features and visual elements to include, and refine them to best impart our desired takeaway on the user.</p>
                  <p>Our final product UI does not mimic any social media site all that closely, but this is intentional. We found during user testing a paper prototype that a traditional vertical layout would bias content selection toward posts at the top. The pie chart was also a later addition. Initially, we simply listed possible interests as keywords, but we learned from users that they were less likely to read an overwhelmingly long list of topics. We toyed with the idea of a hand-drawn representation of the brain, but settled on the pie because it is more faithful to how an algorithm’s idea of a user would change over time.</p>
                  <p>Testing with users (even after our final demo) also revealed that simplicity along with pop-up commentary modals was effective, especially in our exaggeration of the effects of user interactions on our algorithm. Styling of our page was also an important factor, as users perceived a cleaner interface to be more impactful, so we made efforts to better align posts and improve the simulator's visual hierarchy.</p>

                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">Final Result</h2><br/>
                  <p>Our product eventually took the form of a simple, interactive web app meant for users who are new to or not yet familiar with social media. The app gives users a sense of how their clicks determine the content they see. We explain the math behind our algorithm in plain English, and empower the user via encouraging words and real machine learning terms. Different interactions with posts produce slightly different results: sharing changes the pie most drastically, commenting changes it a moderate amount, and liking only slightly changes it. We chose this audience and branding to provide clarity and utility to new social media users, who seemed from our research to need this kind of tool the most.</p>
                  <p>Most importantly, we illustrate how real news can be permanently hidden from the user with a pie chart animation, which represents the probability of seeing each type of post. The slices balance out such that clicking on content from any 1-2 of the 3 categories enough times will always ensure the third probability goes to zero. Before the user's eyes, an echo chamber is quickly created, and the incidence of fake news posts increases. Echo! Echo!</p>
